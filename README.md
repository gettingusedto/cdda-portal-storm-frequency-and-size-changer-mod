# CDDA-Portal Storm Frequency and Size Changer Mod

## Mod Summary
This repo contains 2 mods that can control two aspects of the portal storm: its frequency and size.

portal_storm_frequency allows the ability to change how often the portal storm came to the world when starting a new run (or by activating the `portal_storm_frequency` EOC through debug if you want to change it midgame).

portal_storm_size allows the ability to change the size of the portal storm. you can change the size of the center of the portal storm, the area close to it, and even the distant portal storm when starting a new run (or by activating the `portal_storm_size` EOX through debug if you want to change it midgame).

Example:

Default (50 - 100 - 200)

Twice the size of default (100 - 200 - 400)
